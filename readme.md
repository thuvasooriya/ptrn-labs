# pattern recognition notebooks

This repository contains notebooks on pattern recognition. Originally offered through the module of the same name from the department of electronics and telecommunication engineering at University of Moratuwa. Credit goes to the original author of the notebook [Dr. Sampath Perera](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-sampath-perera/)

Some modifications are made to the original notebooks to make them work on newer versions of python and to add more explanations.
